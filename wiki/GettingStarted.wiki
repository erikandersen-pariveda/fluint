#summary Installing the project

== Installing the Library Project using the SWC ==
If you prefer, you can download the SWC library version from the [http://code.google.com/p/fluint/downloads/list downloads] page. 

=== If you are using Flex 3: ===
Create a new Flex project and copy the fluint_v1.swc file into the libs folder of that Flex project. 

=== If you are using Flex 2: ===
Create a new Flex project. Create a folder named libs in that project and copy the fluint_v1.swc file into the new folder. 

Next, you will need to add this folder to your build path. Do this by:

 * Project properties->Flex Build Path.
 * Click the Library Path Tab.
 * Click the Add SWC Folder button.
 * Browse to the libs folder and click OK.
 * Click OK on the properties panel to close it.

This new Flex project, created with either the source code or the SWC library, will hold your tests and your test runner.

== Installing the Library Project using the Source files ==
