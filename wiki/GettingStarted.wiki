== Installing the Library Project using the Source files ==
dpUInt is a Flex Library project. Clicking on the [http://code.google.com/p/fluint/source/checkout Source] tab above will provide directions for synchronizing directly with the SVN repository, which will ensure continual access to the latest versions.

 * Project properties->Flex Build Path.
 * Click the Library Path Tab.
 * Click the Add Project button.
 * From the popup, select the library project that was just created, and click OK.
 * Click OK on the properties panel to close it.

== Installing the Library Project using the SWC ==
If you prefer, you can download the SWC library version. There is a different version built for Flex 2 and Flex 3, so be sure to grab the correct version.

Create a new Flex project and copy the library SWC file into the project. 

Next, you will need to add this library to your build path. Do this by:

 * Project properties->Flex Build Path.
 * Click the Library Path Tab.
 * Click the Add SWC button.
