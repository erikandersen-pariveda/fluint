This branch is a huge work in progress but the goal is to make Fluint more usable as a UI testing framework rather than just a unit testing framework that knows how to test components.

When I originally branched, I branched from the DPUInt project so I still need to merge at the very least against Fluint trunk. However the dpuint-component-branch project should
build just fine in Flex Builder.
