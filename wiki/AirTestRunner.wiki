#summary AIR Test Runner

= Introduction =

This is a simple test runner targeted for the desktop as opposed to the web browser (get it from the downloads section). The advantage of using this test runner is that you can write the results to an XML file wherever you might like on your drive.


= Details =
Right now, you still need to compile your tests into this test runner, much like the Flex version. However, very shortly, it will support dynamically loading other apps and modules, which can contain those other tests. The advantage becomes a single test runner that is simply invoked with new parameters. 

At that point, your build scripts will only recompile your tests, not the TestRunner. Unfortunately, that is still in the coming soon pile. This is intended to be used with the Ant tasks also available in the downloads section.

You can pass a command line parameter called reportDir, which is where the resultant XML file will be placed. (dpUintResults.xml) In future versions, the renaming of that file as well as the ability to produce multiple files (per suite or case) will also be supported.
