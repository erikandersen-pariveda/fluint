#summary Installing the project

== Installing the Library Project using the SWC ==
If you prefer, you can download the SWC library version from the [http://code.google.com/p/fluint/downloads/list downloads] page. 

=== If you are using Flex 3: ===
Create a new Flex project and copy the fluint.swc file into the libs folder of that Flex project. 

=== If you are using Flex 2: ===
Create a new Flex project. Create a folder named libs in that project and copy the fluint.swc file into the new folder. 

Next, you will need to add this folder to your build path. Do this by:

 * Project properties->Flex Build Path.
 * Click the Library Path Tab.
 * Click the Add SWC Folder button.
 * Browse to the libs folder and click OK.
 * Click OK on the properties panel to close it.

This new Flex project, created with either the source code or the SWC library, will hold your tests and your test runner.

== Installing the Library Project using the Source files ==
Fluint is a combation of projects. Clicking on the [http://code.google.com/p/fluint/source/checkout Source] tab above will provide directions for synchronizing directly with the SVN repository, which will ensure continual access to the latest versions.

Checkout all of the projects from the trunk of the repository.

Each of the projects is described below:

 * `fluint` - Library project used to build fluint.swc
 * `airtestrunner` - AIR project designed to run tests via the command line as well as an automated build environment.
 * `anttasks` - Apache Ant tasks that facilitate the running of the `airtesrunner`
 * `samples` - Sample Flex project with an example test runners for Flex and AIR.  More samples will follow containing the examples from this wiki.
