## fluint - Flex Unit and Integration Testing framework ##

Based loosely on the concepts of FlexUnit and its ancestor JUnit, fluint provides enhanced asynchronous support, a graphical test runner, integration with continuous build systems and an optional Adobe AIR client for directory watching.

It adds support for:

  * Multiple simultaneous asynchronous operations
  * Asynchronous setup and teardown
  * Asynchronous returns before method body completion
  * Support for UIComponent testing
  * Support for test sequences
  * Support for testing Cairngorm commands and controllers
  * XML output of testing results
  * Support for externalizing tests in modules
  * Build automation integration with Apache Ant
