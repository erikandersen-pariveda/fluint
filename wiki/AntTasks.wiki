#summary Ant Tasks for use with the AIR Test Runner

= Introduction =
This tool provides a custom Ant task that can be used to invoke and run your fluint tests from an Ant build file. This set of Ant tasks has some features (such as the <fileset> tag) which are currently ignored by the test runner but will be available in upcoming releases of fluint. 

==Requirements:==
	* The [http://code.google.com/p/fluint/downloads/list fluint Test Runner for AIR].
	* [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant] 1.6.x or later.

==How to use the fluint Ant tag <fluint>:==

	* Place fluintAnt.jar in your system class path so Ant can find it, or import it into the Ant script at runtime with a <PATH> tag
{{{
	<path id="libraries">
		<fileset dir="${targetdir}">
	        	<include name="**/*.jar"/>
	        </fileset>
	</path>
}}}
	* Import and define the fluint Ant tag in your build script with the classname "net.digitalprimates.ant.tasks.fluint.Fluint".
{{{
	<taskdef name="fluint"
		classname="net.digitalprimates.ant.tasks.fluint.Fluint"
		classpathref="libraries" />
}}}

	* Now that the fluint Ant tag has been defined in your build file you can call it with the <fluint> tag, like so:
{{{
	<target name="runTests">
		<fluint
			debug="true"
			headless="false"
			testRunner="C:/Program Files/fluintAir/fluintAir.exe"
			outputDir="${basedir}">
			<fileset dir="${basedir}">
	            		<include name="**/*.swf"/>
			</fileset>
		</fluint>
	</target>
}}}

The attributes of the <fluint> tag are:
	* debug="true|false" - Return debug information to the console
	* headless="true|false" - To run the AIR application in a headless (no UI) mode, or to launch and run the AIR application as a full application. (Please note, this does not mean this can be launched from a truly headless server. Fluint will still instantiate visual objects, just not waste the time showing you a tree and progress bar.)
	* testRunner="" - The path to your installed copy of the fluint AIR application
	* outputDir="" - The location where the test runner should write to disk all of the test results.
	* <fileset> - A fileset of all the Flex test suites modules (compiled as mx:Modules). Pleaase note, the use of the {{{fileSet}}} tag will be explained in detail along with the upcoming updates to fluint.
